Device Management System - Project Report

1. Project Overview
The Device Management System is a web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC that provides a comprehensive solution for managing devices, device categories, and users within an organization. The system enables efficient tracking of device assignments, categorization, and user management.

2. Project Structure
The project follows the standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

/Models
- Device.cs: Represents device information including name, code, status, and relationships
- DeviceCategory.cs: Manages device categorization
- User.cs: Handles user information and device assignments
- Role.cs: Defines user roles and permissions

/Controllers
- DevicesController.cs: Handles device-related operations
- DeviceCategoriesController.cs: Manages category operations
- UsersController.cs: Controls user management features
- HomeController.cs: Manages the dashboard and general navigation

/Views
- Organized by controller with CRUD operations
- Shared layouts and partial views
- Consistent styling across all views
